-- 2. Is LetsMeet membership leveling off?

/*   
-2015 is when LetsMeet experienced its biggest year over year increase in new members. A total of 10,123 new members joined in 2015 which is an increase of 4,452 from the previous. year.

-In 2017, LetsMeet's increase in new members dropped significantly to 363. 

-While New York and San Francisco had a significantly small increase in new members compared to other years, Chicago had 105 less new members join than the previous year. 

-In 2017, the increase in new members dropped significantly in November and December. There were 1,081 new members in October and only 12 new members in December. This seems to be an anomaly and may very well be a mistake in reporting.

-While growth in new members does appear to have levelled off in 2017, the decrease in growth may not be as severe as it appears. It would be beneficial to look into any possible mistakes in membership numbers in October and November of 2017 to get a better understanding of how much growth has levelled off.      */
